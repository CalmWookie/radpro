Are you thinking about buying a Geiger counter or a scintillation detector, or maybe you've already got one and want to make the most of it? In this brief guide we'll give you a glimpse of how to operate these fascinating devices.

## What do Geiger counters/scintillation detectors measure?

Geiger counters and scintillation detectors are instruments capable of detecting and measuring **ionizing radiation**, which consists of particles that carry enough energy to remove electrons from atoms, thus ionizing them. This radiation is particularly hazardous to biological tissues as it can disrupt chemical bonds, damage DNA, cause cellular damage and produce free radicals which in turn can cause even further damage.

## What is a radioactive substance?

A radioactive material is any substance with unstable atomic nuclei that spontaneously disintegrate, releasing ionizing radiationn. This decay process continues until the material transforms into a stable, non-radioactive state.

Examples of such materials include uranium in glass and ceramics, naturally occurring potassium, and medical isotopes like iodine-131 used in treatments.

## What is radioactive contamination?

Radioactive cContamination occurs when radioactive substances are deposited in places where they are not intended or desired:

* **External contamination**: This type of contamination involves radioactive substances on external surfaces such as human skin, clothing, or other objects.
* **Internal contamination**: This occurs when radioactive materials enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through wounds, posing a significant danger due to the close-range interaction with biological tissue.

## What types of ionizing radiation are there?

The most common types of ionizing radiation include:

* **Gamma rays (γ):** These are high-energy photons emitted during nuclear decay. They are highly penetrating and require substantial shielding, such as several centimeters of lead or meters of concrete.
* **X-rays:** Similar to gamma rays but of lower energy, X-rays are less penetrating but  still requiring shielding.
* **Beta particles (β):** These are fast-moving electrons or positrons. They are less penetrating than gamma rays and can be stopped by a few millimeters of aluminum or several meters of air.
* **Alpha particles (α):** Composed of helium nuclei (two protons and two neutrons), alpha particles have low penetration but high energy. They can be blocked by just a few centimeters of air, a sheet of paper, or the outer layer of human skin.
* **Neutrons (n):** Neutrons pose a unique danger they can induce radioactivity upon interaction. Effective shielding for neutrons involves hydrogen-rich materials like water or plastic.

Each type of radiation is associated with specific energy levels, typically measured in electronvolts (eV):

* Gamma rays: Range from 100 keV to 8 MeV.
* X-rays: From 100 eV to 100 keV.
* Beta particles: From a few keV to tens of MeV
* Alpha particles: Typically 3 to 7 MeV
* Neutrons: Can vary from less than 1 eV for slow neutrons to over 1 MeV for fast neutrons.

Generally, particles with higher energy cause more damage.

## How is ionizing radiation measured?

Ionizing radiation is measured through:

### Absorbed dose and rate

Absorbed dose refers to the amount of energy deposited by ionizing radiation per unit mass of any material. It is measured in grays (Gy) in the SI system, where 1 gray equals 1 joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter. In older units, it's measured in rads, where 1 rad equals 0.01 gray.

Absorbed rate is absorbed dose per unit of time.

This measurement quantifies the physical impact of radiation but does not directly account for the biological effects, which depend on the type of radiation.

### Equivalent dose and rate

Equivalent dose is a measure that reflects the **biological damage** to human tissue from exposure to ionizing radiation. It takes into account not only the absorbed dose (energy deposited per unit mass) but also the biological effectiveness (W<sup>R</sup>) of the radiation type. It's measured in sieverts (Sv) in the SI system, where 1 sievert equals the amount of radiation that would have the same biological effect as 1 gray of gamma rays or X-rays. In older units, it's measured in rems, where 1 rem equals 0.01 sievert.

Equivalent rate is equivalent dose per unit of time.

This measurement allows for a more accurate assessment of radiation risk to biological tissues.

## How does a Geiger counter work?

A Geiger counter detects ionizing radiation using a gas-filled tube called a Geiger-Müller tube. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

* **Radiation interaction:** When ionizing radiation (like alpha, beta, or gamma rays) enters the tube, it ionizes some of the gas atoms inside, creating ion pairs (ions and electrons).

* **Amplification:** The tube has a high voltage applied across it. The electrons from the ion pairs are accelerated towards the anode (positive electrode), gaining enough energy to ionize more gas atoms in a chain reaction, which amplifies the initial ionization event.

* **Pulse generation:** This avalanche of ions results in a sudden surge of electrical current, creating a detectable electrical pulse. Each pulse corresponds to a single ionizing event.

* **Counting:** The pulses are counted by electronic circuits, often converting the count into an audible click or visual display, giving an indication of radiation levels. The number of clicks or counts per minute (CPM) reflects the intensity of the radiation.

## How do Geiger counters respond to different types of radiation?

Geiger tubes respond differently to various types of ionizing radiation due to their unique interaction characteristics:

* **Gamma radiation:** Gamma rays, being high-energy photons, can penetrate the Geiger tube's walls. However, standard Geiger tubes are less efficient at detecting low-energy gamma rays compared to higher-energy ones.

* **Beta radiation:** Beta particles can penetrate the window of the Geiger tube if it's thin enough. The response depends on the energy of the beta particles; lower energy betas might not penetrate the tube's wall, while higher energy ones will.

* **Alpha radiation:** Alpha particles cannot be detected by most Geiger tubes as they can't pass through the tube's walls. There exist, however, Pancake Geiger tubes that feature a very thin window (mica or thin metal) that lets alpha particles through; however, due to ther limited penetration, they are often not detected unless the source is very close.

* **Neutron radiation:** Standard Geiger tubes are not directly sensitive to neutrons because neutrons don't ionize gas directly due to their lack of charge. There are, however, specialized tubes that convert the neutrons to particles that can be detected.

Converting a Geiger counter's counts to an equivalent dose involves multiplying the raw counts by a conversion factor, which depends on the Geiger tube, the type of ionizing radiation (α, β, γ, n), the energies of the particles of the radiation, and the intensity of the radiation.

Geiger tube manufacturers usually specify a conversion factor under standard conditions. It can also be calibrated with a known radioactive source.

## What is an energy-compensated Geiger tube?

An energy-compensated Geiger tube is a type of Geiger-Müller counter designed to measure radiation more accurately across different energy levels of ionizing radiation. It includes additional materials or structures, like filters or windows, that adjust the response of the tube so that it detects radiation with a sensitivity that is more uniform across various energies. This compensation helps to ensure that the readings are not disproportionately influenced by either low-energy or high-energy particles, providing a more accurate measure of total radiation exposure.

## What is a scintillation detector?

A scintillation detector is a type of radiation detector that uses a material, known as a scintillator, which emits light (scintillates) when struck by ionizing radiation. This light is then converted into an electrical signal by a photomultiplier tube or a photodiode. The key components include:

* **Scintillator material:** This can be organic (like plastics) or inorganic (like sodium iodide doped with thallium, NaI(Tl)). The choice of material depends on the type of radiation to detect (alpha, beta, gamma, or neutrons) and the energy range.

* **Photodetector:** Converts the light photons into an electrical signal. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are commonly used for their high sensitivity, but photodiodes are also used, especially where space or power consumption is a concern.
Signal Processing: The electrical signal is then amplified, shaped, and can be analyzed to determine the energy, type, and intensity of the radiation.

Scintillation detectors are valued for their fast response times and the capacity to determine the energy levels (also known as spectroscopy), which allows to identify the source of radiation.

## Applications of Geiger counters/scintillation detectors

### Mineral exploration

Geologists use Geiger counters to detect uranium, thorium, and other radioactive minerals. This helps in mapping geological formations.

Even though the most common isotope of uranium, Uranium-238, decays into Thorium-234 by emitting an alpha particle—which is generally undetectable by standard Geiger counters without a mica window—the decay continues producing daughter products that emit detectable beta radiation.

Similarly, Thorium-232, the predominant isotope of thorium, follows a decay path that also leads to the emission of detectable beta radiation from its daughter products.

### Radiation monitoring

Geiger counters are essential for monitoring radiation levels in areas affected by nuclear accidents or waste disposal sites. They help in assessing contamination levels in soil, water, and air.

The most prevalent isotopes released during nuclear accidents are:

* **Iodine-131:** With a half-life of approximately 8 days, this isotope is particularly hazardous due to its uptake by the thyroid gland, which can lead to thyroid cancer with significant exposure. It was notably released during the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters.

* **Cesium-137:** Its half-life is around 30 years, making it a significant long-term environmental pollutant. Cesium-137 contaminates soil and water, leading to prolonged radiation exposure. It played a critical role in both the Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents.

* **Strontium-90:** This isotope, with a half-life of about 29 years, has a tendency to accumulate in bones, where it mimics calcium. It was significantly released during the Chernobyl disaster and remains a concern in other nuclear events.

These isotopes can be detected by standard Geiger counters as they decay through beta and gamma radiation.

These isotopes are among the primary concerns due to their biological impact, environmental persistence, and the scale of their release during nuclear accidents. Other isotopes like carbon-14, tritium (hydrogen-3), and various plutonium isotopes might also be released but are either less common or less immediately hazardous in the context of a nuclear accident.

### Food safety

Countries use Geiger counters to screen imported food items for isotopes, especially from regions with known nuclear incidents or high background radiation levels. This ensures that imported foods do not exceed safe radiation levels.

### Radiation therapy oversight

In hospitals, Geiger counters check for radiation leakage from equipment like X-ray machines to ensure patient and staff safety.

In radiation therapy, several isotopes are commonly utilized for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes:

* **Iodine-131:** Primarily used for treating thyroid cancer. It is administered orally and is absorbed by thyroid cells, including cancer cells, where it emits beta particles to destroy them.

* **Iodine-125:** Used in brachytherapy, especially for prostate cancer, where tiny "seeds" containing the isotope are implanted directly into the tumor to deliver radiation over time.

* **Cobalt-60:** Traditionally used in teletherapy for external beam radiation therapy, though its use has declined with the rise of linear accelerators. It can still be used for certain treatments due to its gamma ray emissions.

* **Iridium-192:** Another isotope used in brachytherapy, particularly in high-dose-rate (HDR) treatments where the source is temporarily placed within the body to treat cancers like those of the cervix, breast, and prostate.

* **Cesium-137:** Has been used in brachytherapy for gynecologic treatments, though less commonly now due to availability issues.

* **Yttrium-90:** Utilized in targeted therapies like selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) for liver tumors and in radioimmunotherapy for certain lymphomas.

* **Radium-223:** Specifically used for the treatment of bone metastases from prostate cancer. It targets bone tissue, sparing surrounding healthy tissues due to its alpha particle emissions.

* **Lutetium-177:** Increasingly used in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) for neuroendocrine tumors, where it is linked to peptides that target tumor cells.

All these isotopes can be detected by standard Geiger counters as they decay through beta and gamma radiation.

Each of these isotopes has specific properties that make them suitable for particular types of cancer treatment, focusing on delivering radiation to cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

### SHTF (shit hits the fan)

In the event of a nuclear incident, Geiger counters are vital for survivors to navigate through contaminated areas safely, identifying safe zones and avoiding highly radioactive spots. They also allow checking food and water for radioactive substances.

### Radiation from household items

* **Objective:** Identify items in your home that emit radiation.

* **Method:** Measure radiation from items like smoke detectors (which contain small amounts of Americium-241), old watches with radium dials, ceramic pottery with uranium glaze, or Brazilian granite countertops. Document the radiation levels and compare them to background levels to see if they're significantly above normal.

* **WARNING:** In order to avoid internal contamination, wear gloves when handling radioactive objects like uranium rocks. Also, place them in sealed plastic bags in order to minimize the risk of external contamination.

### Radiation shielding experiment

* **Objective:** Understand how different materials shield against radiation.

* **Method:** Place a known radioactive source (like a small piece of uranium ore or a radioactive check source) beside the Geiger counter. Measure the count rate. Then, introduce various materials (lead, aluminum, paper, wood, water) between the source and the counter, noting the reduction in counts for each material.

* **WARNING:** In order to avoid internal contamination, wear gloves when handling radioactive objects like uranium rocks. Also, place them in sealed plastic bags in order to minimize the risk of external contamination.

### Experiment with distance (inverse square law)

* **Objective:** Demonstrate how radiation decreases with distance from the source.

* **Method:** Place a radioactive source at a fixed position and take measurements at increasing distances from the source. Plot the count rate vs. distance to verify the inverse square law of radiation.

* **WARNING:** In order to avoid internal contamination, wear gloves when handling radioactive objects like uranium rocks. Also, place them in sealed plastic bags in order to minimize the risk of external contamination.

### Altitude effects on radiation

* **Objective:** Study how cosmic radiation changes with altitude.

* **Method:** If possible, take the Geiger counter on a trip up a mountain, in an airplane, or use a weather balloon. Record the radiation levels at different altitudes to see the increase in cosmic radiation exposure.

### Radon gas detection

* **Objective:** Measure radon levels in homes or buildings.

* **Method:** Use the Geiger counter in areas where radon might accumulate (like basements). Note that this might require a specialized radon detection kit, but you can start by checking general radiation levels.
