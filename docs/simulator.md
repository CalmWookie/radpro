# Rad Pro simulator

The Rad Pro simulator is a tool used for developing Rad Pro, but you can also download it to try the firmware before installing.

Download the appropriate simulator from the [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).

Measurements are simulated. The arrow keys let you navigate the menus, the return key functions as the ok/power key. You can also press the left and right CTRL key to, respectively, decrease or increase the simulated level of radiation.

The simulator tries to automatically connect to the first available serial port. To test Rad Pro's serial communications locally, install a null-modem emulator (for example [com0com](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/)) and connect with a serial terminal to the second available serial port.
